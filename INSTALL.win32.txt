OSCATS: Open-Source Computerized Adaptive Testing System
--------------------------------------------------------

OSCATS facilitates the development of computerized adaptive tests and
simulations of computerized adaptive tests.  It consists of a library
written in object-oriented C using the GObject framework, along with
bindings to Python, Perl, PHP, and Java.

Dependencies
------------

OSCATS depends on the following packages:

- GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
- Glib 2, including GObject (http://www.gtk.org)

- pkg-config, optional (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
- PyGObject module, for Python bindings (http://live.gnome.org/PyGObject)
- Perl Glib module, for Perl bindings (http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net)
- PHP-GTK extension, for PHP bindings (http://gtk.php.net)


Windows Binary Installation
---------------------------

The liboscats-0.dll file in C\bin is required for all bindings.  The
directory in which it is installed must be included in the system path.

For compiling with the C library:
- Place the content of the C directory in the location of your choice
  (e.g. C:\oscats).
- Add the bin directory to your system path (e.g. C:\oscats\bin).
- Add the lib\pkgconfig directory to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable
  (e.g. C:\oscats\lib\pkgconfig).

For the Python bindings:
- Note: This package is compiled for Python 2.7.
- Place the oscats.pyd from Python27 in your Python's site-packages directory
  (e.g. C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages).
- Alternatively, you may specify the location of oscats.pyd in PYTHONPATH.

For the Perl bindings:
- Place the contents of the Perl directory in your Perl's site\lib directory
  (e.g. C:\Perl5\site\lib).
- Alternatively, you may specify an alternative location with the -i switch.

For the PHP bindings:
- Place the php_oscats.dll file in your PHP extensions directory
  (e.g. C:\php5\ext).
- Load the extension with one of the following:
  - Add to php.ini: extension = php_oscats.dll
  - On the command line: -Dextension=php_oscats.dll
  - Dynamically in PHP code (see examples)

For the Java bindings:
- Place the contents of the Java directory in the location of your choice
  (e.g. C:\oscats\java).
- Add that directory to your system path.
- Be sure to include the directory in your Java classpath.

For use of Java in Matlab:
- Add the location of the lib*jni-0.dll files (from Java bindings
  installation) to Matlab's toolbox\local\librarypath.txt file.
- Add the glib.jar and oscats.jar files to the Java classpath with the
  javaaddpath Matlab function.
