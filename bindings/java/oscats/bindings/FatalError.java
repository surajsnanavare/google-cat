/**
 * A general error. These are thrown when an unexpected state is encountered
 * in the process of binding an underlying native library, and are intended to
 * be fatal. We throw a Java Error this in hopes of getting a stack trace
 * rather than the segmentation fault that will inevitably occur if execution
 * goes much further. Sometimes we even get it right.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In most cases these are instantiated by java-gnome's internal native code
 * and thrown from there.
 *

 * See {@link org.gnome.glib.FatalError} for the Throwable emitted when
 * "critical" and other fatal problems occur within GLib, GTK, and the other
 * GNOME libraries.
