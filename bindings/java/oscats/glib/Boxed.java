/**
 * Parent class of proxied structures. Java side, these behave like normal
 * {@link org.gnome.glib.Object Object}s, but they are not as rich - they may
 * be missing getters or setters (or both!), for example.

 * In general, Boxed are short lived. They are commonly used to convey
 * parameters or represent state such as in an Iterator. As such, good
 * programming practise is to <b>not</b> hold on to these long term. Use them
 * and let them go out of scope so they can be reclaimed.

 * <i>In the underlying GLib library, a <code>GBoxed</code> is an opaque
 * wrapper around a C structure allowing it to be used within GLib's Type
 * system. <code>GBoxed</code> generally have custom <code>copy()</code> and
 * <code>free()</code> functions. Unlike <code>GObjects</code> they are not
 * memory managed via the reference counting mechanism, and so the owner of a
 * <code>GBoxed</code> is responsible to free it. The trick is to figure out
 * whether we are owner of the <code>GBoxed</code> or not...</i>
