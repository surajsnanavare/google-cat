OSCATS facilitates the development of computerized adaptive tests and
simulations of computerized adaptive tests.  It consists of a library
written in object-oriented C using the GObject framework, along with
bindings to Python, Perl, PHP, and Java.

Dependencies
------------

OSCATS depends on the following packages:

- GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
- Glib 2, including GObject (http://www.gtk.org)
- pkg-config, optional (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
- PyGObject module, for Python bindings (http://www.pygtk.org)
- Perl Glib module, for Perl bindings (http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net)
- PHP-GTK extension, for PHP bindings (http://gtk.php.net)


Building
--------

The base C library can be built with:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

The default installation location is /usr/local.  Alternate locations can be
specified with the --prefix option to configure.  If you will be linking
against the OSCATS C library in a non-standard location, you may need to set
the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for pkg-config. By default, none of
the language bindings are included; to build these, use the
--enable-*-bindings options.
